It is the primary goal of our research to develop a model that can predict whether or not a student will pass the final test based on the log data from laboratory sessions recorded on the Deeds system. By using this approach, teachers may warn individuals who are at risk of failing at the end of the course in order to assist them in regaining their learning schedule.
